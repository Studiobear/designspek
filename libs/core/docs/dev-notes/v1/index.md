# Onwards to Designspek V1

Designspek is a reactive UX/UI design system library inspired by the near-magical simplicity of SvelteJS's reactive nature and need found in the the lacking of style systems harnessing that reactivity.

**What _is_ a "reactive UX/UI design system"?**

Design systems generally begin from the core design domains of space, typography and color.

_How much space and where an element should be positioned. What typeface family, size and weight should be used for each given element. The colors projected by a brand to set the mood and tone of the information and functionality provided. Etc._

Not too long ago, the sum decisions of a given design would be presented in a static mockup, a.k.a. an image, of the product to be having been created in something like Adobe Photoshop. If the designer was really diligent, multiple takes of the same view would be presented showing what it looked like when a user hovered over menu item revealing a dropdown or the active state of clicking on a button. Covering mostly CSS pseudo classes and few exceptions
