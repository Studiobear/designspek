A step back is taken to recognize from a broad perspective the 30-ish some years since the mainstreaming of The Internet. Fire up your browser and "surf" like in the days of old and it might be surprising to find that at a glance, things haven't changed all that much. There is certainly more visual content from large images to streaming media to _oh, so many!_ icons. Yet, the prevalent form of communication is as it always was — text, text and more text. For the most part, aesthetics have improved but not in a lavish manner as one might expect in a thirty-year leaping bound. Instead, is an informational culture born of forced-restraint in spite of the underlying and inherent bond with rapid technoligical advances across the board. This referred restraint of necessity becomes an important reminder to the purpose of all this cybernetic wonder: tools for its users — _human beings_.

To be clear, restraint from this perspective is viewed in a positive light. Afterall, simplicity is the height of sophistication. The important takeaway is recognizing that as Internet technology has generally bowed to the needs and whims of people (and rightly so), perhaps the systems, processes and tools used to develop
